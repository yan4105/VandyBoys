## Project Description
This project looks to calculate arm angle in degrees for each session (bullpens and game). Ideally, this would be broken down for each pitch type and given a session average, along with a breakdown of angle for each pitch.

The coach is trying to dive into how orientation and also this metric plays into movement. He believes this metric could also enable us to easily identify when someone has made a mechanical change potentially so we could fix it quickly. He thinks post log with the data we have collected we could do this for this past fall to give us an idea of where everyone was at with their slot heading into the spring.
